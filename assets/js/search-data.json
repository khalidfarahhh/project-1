            "content": "Class and Object Terms . The foundations of Object-Oriented Programming is defining a Class . In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

Algorithms with a polynomial efficiency or slower (constant, linear, square, cube, etc.) are said to run in a reasonable amount of time. Algorithms with exponential or factorial efficiencies are examples of algorithms that run in an unreasonable amount of time. Some problems can not be solved in a reasonable amount of time, so when this is the case, an approximate solution is found. . | . Hack 1 . A decidable problem is a problem for which an algorithm or a procedure can be written that always terminates after a finite number of steps and correctly answers whether a given input to the problem is a valid solution or not. An example of a decidable problem is determining whether a given string of text is a palindrome (a word or phrase that reads the same forwards and backwards). An undecidable problem is a problem for which it is impossible to design an algorithm or a procedure that always terminates and correctly answers whether a given input is a valid solution or not. An example of an undecidable problem is the Halting problem, which is the problem of determining, given a description of an arbitrary computer program and an input, whether the program will finish running or continue to run forever. .

Bytes are a unit of measurement for data storage, consisting of eight bits. . Hexadecimal, or hex, is a number system with base 16, often used in computing to represent binary data in a more human-readable format. . Nibbles are a unit of measurement for data, consisting of four bits. . A binary number is a number represented using only the digits 0 and 1. . An unsigned integer is a binary number that represents a non-negative whole number, without any representation of sign. . A signed integer is a binary number that represents a whole number, with a separate representation of sign (positive or negative). . A floating point number is a binary number that represents a real number, with a separate representation of the decimal point. . A Boolean is a binary data type that can take on one of two possible values, representing true or false. . ASCII is a character encoding standard that represents each letter, digit, and symbol as a unique binary number. . Unicode is a character encoding standard that represents most of the world’s written languages, including all of the characters in ASCII, as well as many additional characters. . RGB (Red-Green-Blue) is a color model used in computing to represent colors as a combination of red, green, and blue values. . Data compression is the process of reducing the amount of data required to represent a given amount of information, typically to save space or transmission time. . Lossy data compression involves discarding some of the data in order to achieve a higher level of compression. . Lossless data compression involves preserving all of the data, but encoding it in a more compact form. . Unit 3… Algorithm/Programming Terms | . A variable is a named location in a computer’s memory that is used to store a value. The value stored in a variable can be changed, and the same variable can be used to store different values at different times. . Data types are the classification of data based on their type and the operations that can be performed on them. Common data types include integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and Booleans. . A list is a collection of data items that are organized in a specific order. In Python, lists are represented using square brackets and can contain any data type, including other lists. . A 2D list is a list that contains other lists as its items. This allows for the creation of data structures that have more than one dimension, such as a grid or a table. . A dictionary is a data structure that uses keys to map to values. In Python, dictionaries are represented using curly braces and can contain any data type. . A class is a template or blueprint for creating objects in object-oriented programming. Classes define the properties and behaviors of objects, and objects are instances of a class. . An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or achieving a specific goal. Algorithms are used in many different fields, including computer science, mathematics, and engineering. . A sequence is a type of control structure in which a set of instructions are executed in a specific order. . Selection is a type of control structure in which a specific set of instructions are executed based on the evaluation of a condition. . Iteration is a type of control structure in which a set of instructions are repeated until a specific condition is met. . An expression is a combination of variables, operators, and other elements that produces a value. In programming, expressions are often used in control structures to evaluate conditions. . Comparison operators are operators that are used to compare two values. In Python, the comparison operators include &lt; (less than), &gt; (greater than), == (equal to), and != (not equal to). . Boolean expressions are expressions that evaluate to either true or false. In programming, Boolean expressions are often used in control structures to determine which instructions to execute. . Selection statements are control structures that use Boolean expressions to evaluate conditions and decide which instructions to execute. In Python, the selection statement is the if statement. . Iteration statements are control structures that repeat a set of instructions until a specific condition is met. In Python, the iteration statements are the for and while loops. . A truth table is a table that shows the possible combinations of inputs and outputs for a logical operation. Truth tables are often used to evaluate the behavior of Boolean expressions. . Characters are the basic building blocks of a string. In Python, characters are represented as single quotes (e.g. ‘a’) and can be any letter, number, or symbol. . Strings are collections of characters that are used to represent text. In Python, strings are represented as double quotes (e.g. “Hello”) or single quotes (e.g. ‘Hello’). . The length of a string is the number of characters it contains. In Python, the length of a string can be found using the len() function. . Concatenation is the process of joining two or more strings together to form a new string. In Python, concatenation is performed using the + operator. . The upper() and lower() methods are used to convert a string to all uppercase or all lowercase characters . Traversing a string means to access each character in the string one by one. In Python, this can be done using a for loop and the len() function to iterate over the characters in a string. . The if, elif, and else keywords are used in Python to create conditional statements. . The if statement is used to evaluate a condition and execute a specific set of instructions if the condition is true. . The elif statement is used to evaluate additional conditions if the original if condition is false. . The else statement is used to specify a default set of instructions to execute if all other conditions are false. . Nested selection statements are if statements that are placed inside of other if statements. This allows for the creation of complex conditional statements that can evaluate multiple conditions. . The for and while loops are used in Python to repeat a set of instructions multiple times. The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence of items, such as the elements of a list. The while loop is used to repeat a set of instructions as long as a specific condition is true. . The range() function is used in Python to generate a sequence of numbers. This can be used in a for loop to specify the number of times to repeat the loop. . The break and continue keywords are used in Python to control the flow of a loop. The break keyword is used to exit a loop completely, while the continue keyword is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next iteration. . Procedural abstraction is the process of separating the details of how a task is performed from the overall logic of the program. In Python, this is achieved using def procedures, which allow for the creation of reusable blocks of code that can be called from other parts of the program. . Parameters are variables that are used to pass information into a def procedure. When a procedure is called, the values of the parameters are specified and are used by the procedure to perform its tasks. . Return values are the values that are returned by a def procedure after it has finished executing. Return values can be used by the calling code to access the results of the procedure’s operations. .",

To me its less about the grade and more about what I learn about coding and my self. This was a huge learning experience as I now know my habits in a course like this and some of the basic coding tools. I know that this upcoming tri I will get an A as I know what the teachers are looking for specifically and what they arent looking for. It was a very fun course to say the least and was a intresting new perspective on how classes could be taught. Project based learning was definitelty a highlight of the course as it was free will to learn without gidelines. I look foward to moving to the second trimester of this course with lots of learning and more effort. . Final Exam Correction . A little confused because it says already a list of of food and dietary restrictions so I this is a unclear question. . Didnt know the answer so searched it up and seems so that google is not efficent as it gave me the wrong answer. . Also searched this up and showed me the exact question with the answer so I find it odd I still got it wrong. . This in my opinion used more logical math and physics then computer science and at the time my state of mind was completly and only computer science. . Followed the errows which I was later educated on that arrows do not mean anything in code so they were deceiving in sending me another way to solve the question. . Questions I searched up . Question #16 Question #17 Question #19 Question #20 Question #25 Question #30 . Strengths and weakness . I think my strengths in this class are definetely more front end stuff and the visual pleasure of the website. I feel its more simple and the work I put in is rewarded better in a sense because of how I can see my work. My weakness would have to be backend and the more complicated coding aspect.

An application programming interface (API) is the medium by which different systems of software interact. In our applications we have two big systems:1. Python Backend that stores data beyond a single Web page2. GH Pages/Fastpages Frontend that is responsible for presenting data . To communicate data between Frontend and Backend, this section Backend code provides and interface to the Frontend using a Web Service Endpoint. Examples of endpoints are listed below and can be typed within a browser, which will return JSON data: . https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/2 | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/random | . As you can see, these Endpoints return JSON. They are NOT that readable by normal humans. However, they are very effective in passing requested data across the Internet. The Frontend code is responsible for formatting and presenting and interface that allows the typical computer user to interact with this data. . The next cell of code is Creating Endpoints that return JSON. This allows developers in the Frontend to interact with Backend data. API is a contract between the Frontend and Backend on how to share data. . FYI, there is NO output from this section . . from flask import Blueprint, jsonify # jsonify creates an endpoint response object from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building import requests # used for testing import random # Blueprints allow this code to be procedurally abstracted from main.py, meaning code is not all in one place app_api = Blueprint(&#39;api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/jokes&#39;) # endpoint prefix avoid redundantly typing /api/jokes over and over # API generator https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id1 api = Api(app_api) class JokesAPI: # not implemented, this would be where we would allow creation of a new Joke class _Create(Resource): def post(self, joke): pass # getJokes() class _Read(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getJokes()) # getJoke(id) class _ReadID(Resource): def get(self, id): return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadRandom(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getRandomJoke()) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadCount(Resource): def get(self): count = countJokes() countMsg = {&#39;count&#39;: count} return jsonify(countMsg) # put method: addJokeHaHa class _UpdateLike(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeHaHa(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # put method: addJokeBooHoo class _UpdateJeer(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeBooHoo(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # building RESTapi interfaces, these routes are added to Web Server http://&lt;server&lt;/api/jokes api.add_resource(_Create, &#39;/create/&lt;string:joke&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_Read, &#39;/&#39;) # default, which returns all jokes api.add_resource(_ReadID, &#39;/&lt;int:id&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadRandom, &#39;/random&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadCount, &#39;/count&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateLike, &#39;/like/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateJeer, &#39;/jeer/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) .

An API and a little coding logic will be a big step toward getting meaningful data for a project. There are many API providers, find one that might work for your project to complete this hack. When picking an API you are looking for something that will work with either JavaScript Fetch or Python Request. Here are some samples, these are not qualified in any way. . RapidAPI- GitHub Project | No Key APIs Article | Twitter Developer | Google Developer | Reddit Developer | . Show API and format results in either Web Page or Jupyter Notebook. Ultimately, I will expect that we do APIs in backend (Python/Flask). However, for this Hack you can pick your preference. We will discuss pros and cons in next API tech talk. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .
