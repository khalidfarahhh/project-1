Explore SQLite Connect object to establish database connection- Explore SQLite Cursor Object to fetch data from a table within a database | . Schema of Users table in Sqlite.db . Uses PRAGMA statement to read schema. . Describe Schema, here is resource Resource- What is a database schema? . What is the purpose of identity Column in SQL database? | What is the purpose of a primary key in SQL database? | What are the Data Types in SQL table? | . import sqlite3 database = &#39;files/sqlite.db&#39; # this is location of database def schema(): # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries cursor = conn.cursor() # Fetch results of Schema results = cursor.execute(&quot;PRAGMA table_info(&#39;users&#39;)&quot;).fetchall() # Print the results for row in results: print(row) # Close the database connection conn.close() schema() . Reading Users table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL SELECT statement to read data . What is a connection object? After you google it, what do you think it does? | Same for cursor object? | Look at conn object and cursor object in VSCode debugger. What attributes are in the object? | Is &quot;results&quot; an object? How do you know? | . import sqlite3 def read(): # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries cursor = conn.cursor() # Execute a SELECT statement to retrieve data from a table results = cursor.execute(&#39;SELECT * FROM users&#39;).fetchall() # Print the results if len(results) == 0: print(&quot;Table is empty&quot;) else: for row in results: print(row) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() read() . Create a new User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL INSERT to add row . Compore create() in both SQL lessons. What is better or worse in the two implementations? | Explain purpose of SQL INSERT. Is this the same as User init? | . import sqlite3 def create(): name = input(&quot;Enter your name:&quot;) uid = input(&quot;Enter your user id:&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter your password&quot;) dob = input(&quot;Enter your date of birth &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39;&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to insert data into a table cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO users (_name, _uid, _password, _dob) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (name, uid, password, dob)) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() print(f&quot;A new user record {uid} has been created&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the INSERT:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #create() . Updating a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL UPDATE to modify password . What does the hacked part do? | Explain try/except, when would except occur? | What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated? | . import sqlite3 def update(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to update&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter updated password&quot;) if len(password) &lt; 2: message = &quot;hacked&quot; password = &#39;gothackednewpassword123&#39; else: message = &quot;successfully updated&quot; # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to update data in a table cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE users SET _password = ?

Delete a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses a delete function to remove a user based on a user input of the id. . Is DELETE a dangerous operation? Why? | What is the &quot;f&quot; and {uid} do? | . import sqlite3 def delete(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to delete&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM users WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (uid,)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: # The uid was found in the table and the row was deleted print(f&quot;The row with uid {uid} was successfully deleted&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the DELETE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #delete() . Menu Interface to CRUD operations . CRUD and Schema interactions from one location by running menu. Observe input at the top of VSCode, observe output underneath code cell. . Why does the menu repeat? | Could you refactor this menu? Make it work with a List? | . def menu(): operation = input(&quot;Enter: (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate or (D)elete or (S)chema&quot;) if operation.lower() == &#39;c&#39;: create() elif operation.lower() == &#39;r&#39;: read() elif operation.lower() == &#39;u&#39;: update() elif operation.lower() == &#39;d&#39;: delete() elif operation.lower() == &#39;s&#39;: schema() elif len(operation)==0: # Escape Key return else: print(&quot;Please enter c, r, u, or d&quot;) menu() # recursion, repeat menu try: menu() # start menu except: print(&quot;Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu&quot;) .

Machine Learning Visit Tutorials Point . Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. . Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. .

Algorithms with a polynomial efficiency or slower (constant, linear, square, cube, etc.) are said to run in a reasonable amount of time. Algorithms with exponential or factorial efficiencies are examples of algorithms that run in an unreasonable amount of time. Some problems can not be solved in a reasonable amount of time, so when this is the case, an approximate solution is found. . | . Hack 1 . A decidable problem is a problem for which an algorithm or a procedure can be written that always terminates after a finite number of steps and correctly answers whether a given input to the problem is a valid solution or not. An example of a decidable problem is determining whether a given string of text is a palindrome (a word or phrase that reads the same forwards and backwards). An undecidable problem is a problem for which it is impossible to design an algorithm or a procedure that always terminates and correctly answers whether a given input is a valid solution or not. An example of an undecidable problem is the Halting problem, which is the problem of determining, given a description of an arbitrary computer program and an input, whether the program will finish running or continue to run forever. .

Nibbles are a unit of measurement for data, consisting of four bits. . A binary number is a number represented using only the digits 0 and 1. . An unsigned integer is a binary number that represents a non-negative whole number, without any representation of sign. . A signed integer is a binary number that represents a whole number, with a separate representation of sign (positive or negative). . A floating point number is a binary number that represents a real number, with a separate representation of the decimal point. . A Boolean is a binary data type that can take on one of two possible values, representing true or false. . ASCII is a character encoding standard that represents each letter, digit, and symbol as a unique binary number. . Unicode is a character encoding standard that represents most of the world’s written languages, including all of the characters in ASCII, as well as many additional characters. . RGB (Red-Green-Blue) is a color model used in computing to represent colors as a combination of red, green, and blue values. . Data compression is the process of reducing the amount of data required to represent a given amount of information, typically to save space or transmission time. . Lossy data compression involves discarding some of the data in order to achieve a higher level of compression. . Lossless data compression involves preserving all of the data, but encoding it in a more compact form. . Unit 3… Algorithm/Programming Terms | . A variable is a named location in a computer’s memory that is used to store a value. The value stored in a variable can be changed, and the same variable can be used to store different values at different times. . Data types are the classification of data based on their type and the operations that can be performed on them. Common data types include integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and Booleans. . A list is a collection of data items that are organized in a specific order. In Python, lists are represented using square brackets and can contain any data type, including other lists. . A 2D list is a list that contains other lists as its items. This allows for the creation of data structures that have more than one dimension, such as a grid or a table. . A dictionary is a data structure that uses keys to map to values. In Python, dictionaries are represented using curly braces and can contain any data type. . A class is a template or blueprint for creating objects in object-oriented programming. Classes define the properties and behaviors of objects, and objects are instances of a class. . An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or achieving a specific goal. Algorithms are used in many different fields, including computer science, mathematics, and engineering. . A sequence is a type of control structure in which a set of instructions are executed in a specific order. . Selection is a type of control structure in which a specific set of instructions are executed based on the evaluation of a condition. . Iteration is a type of control structure in which a set of instructions are repeated until a specific condition is met. . An expression is a combination of variables, operators, and other elements that produces a value. In programming, expressions are often used in control structures to evaluate conditions. . Comparison operators are operators that are used to compare two values. In Python, the comparison operators include &lt; (less than), &gt; (greater than), == (equal to), and != (not equal to). . Boolean expressions are expressions that evaluate to either true or false. In programming, Boolean expressions are often used in control structures to determine which instructions to execute. . Selection statements are control structures that use Boolean expressions to evaluate conditions and decide which instructions to execute. In Python, the selection statement is the if statement. . Iteration statements are control structures that repeat a set of instructions until a specific condition is met. In Python, the iteration statements are the for and while loops. . A truth table is a table that shows the possible combinations of inputs and outputs for a logical operation. Truth tables are often used to evaluate the behavior of Boolean expressions. . Characters are the basic building blocks of a string. In Python, characters are represented as single quotes (e.g. ‘a’) and can be any letter, number, or symbol. . Strings are collections of characters that are used to represent text. In Python, strings are represented as double quotes (e.g. “Hello”) or single quotes (e.g. ‘Hello’). . The length of a string is the number of characters it contains. In Python, the length of a string can be found using the len() function. . Concatenation is the process of joining two or more strings together to form a new string. In Python, concatenation is performed using the + operator. . The upper() and lower() methods are used to convert a string to all uppercase or all lowercase characters . Traversing a string means to access each character in the string one by one. In Python, this can be done using a for loop and the len() function to iterate over the characters in a string. . The if, elif, and else keywords are used in Python to create conditional statements. . The if statement is used to evaluate a condition and execute a specific set of instructions if the condition is true. . The elif statement is used to evaluate additional conditions if the original if condition is false. . The else statement is used to specify a default set of instructions to execute if all other conditions are false. . Nested selection statements are if statements that are placed inside of other if statements. This allows for the creation of complex conditional statements that can evaluate multiple conditions. . The for and while loops are used in Python to repeat a set of instructions multiple times. The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence of items, such as the elements of a list. The while loop is used to repeat a set of instructions as long as a specific condition is true. . The range() function is used in Python to generate a sequence of numbers. This can be used in a for loop to specify the number of times to repeat the loop. . The break and continue keywords are used in Python to control the flow of a loop. The break keyword is used to exit a loop completely, while the continue keyword is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next iteration. . Procedural abstraction is the process of separating the details of how a task is performed from the overall logic of the program. In Python, this is achieved using def procedures, which allow for the creation of reusable blocks of code that can be called from other parts of the program. . Parameters are variables that are used to pass information into a def procedure. When a procedure is called, the values of the parameters are specified and are used by the procedure to perform its tasks. . Return values are the values that are returned by a def procedure after it has finished executing. Return values can be used by the calling code to access the results of the procedure’s operations. .",

(answer) 75 (75 is lower than 80) 2. How is an if statement different from an if-else statement. . Extra words. An if statement will only go through a process if a condition is met. An if-else statement will go through code no matter the conditions. (answer) They are the exact same. An if statement will go through the entire code segment every single time and the if-else statement is always used in an algorithm, no matter the conditions. (statement must be made in order to go through the code) 3. What would be most appropriate for this situation? Ben wants to check his bank account. If his car fuel is full, he will go to the bank. Otherwise, he will go home. If he goes to the bank, he will withdraw money only if his balance is above $1000. . If statement If-else statement (answer) (if he had gas he would go, but no gas means don’t go) 4. What would be most appropriate for this situation? Luke wants to play basketball. If it is sunny outside he will go to the park to play basketball. . If statement (answer) If-else statement (doesn’t say what he’s doing when not sunny) Using Python animals = [“lion”, “tiger”, “wildebeest”, “shark”, “jellyfish”, “blobfish”, “raven”] . for i in animals: if i == “shark”: # What boolean value does this statement cause? print(“Fun Fact: The smallest shark is the dwarf lantern shark, and it is small enough to hold in your hand!”) else: print(i) for i in animals: if i == “lion” or “wildebeest” or “raven”: print(“This animal lives in the desert”) .

If they have at least 2 issues, check that they have completed at least 5 of their scrumboard tasks. If they have completed 5 scrumboard tasks, give the student a 2.7. If they have not completed 5 scrumboard tasks, give them a score of 2.5. If they have completed more than 5 tasks, give them a score of 3.0. How much would a student with 3 issues and 1 complete scrumboard task receive? . Answer The person would recieve a 2.0 because they have three issues which is more than 2, but they can’t get more points because they don’t have 5 scrumboard tasks completed. .",

I know that this upcoming tri I will get an A as I know what the teachers are looking for specifically and what they arent looking for. It was a very fun course to say the least and was a intresting new perspective on how classes could be taught. Project based learning was definitelty a highlight of the course as it was free will to learn without gidelines.

Didnt know the answer so searched it up and seems so that google is not efficent as it gave me the wrong answer. . Also searched this up and showed me the exact question with the answer so I find it odd I still got it wrong. . This in my opinion used more logical math and physics then computer science and at the time my state of mind was completly and only computer science. . Followed the errows which I was later educated on that arrows do not mean anything in code so they were deceiving in sending me another way to solve the question. . Questions I searched up . Question #16 Question #17 Question #19 Question #20 Question #25 Question #30 . Strengths and weakness . I think my strengths in this class are definetely more front end stuff and the visual pleasure of the website. I feel its more simple and the work I put in is rewarded better in a sense because of how I can see my work. My weakness would have to be backend and the more complicated coding aspect.

An application programming interface (API) is the medium by which different systems of software interact. In our applications we have two big systems:1. Python Backend that stores data beyond a single Web page2. GH Pages/Fastpages Frontend that is responsible for presenting data . To communicate data between Frontend and Backend, this section Backend code provides and interface to the Frontend using a Web Service Endpoint. Examples of endpoints are listed below and can be typed within a browser, which will return JSON data: . https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/2 | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/random | . As you can see, these Endpoints return JSON. They are NOT that readable by normal humans. However, they are very effective in passing requested data across the Internet. The Frontend code is responsible for formatting and presenting and interface that allows the typical computer user to interact with this data. . The next cell of code is Creating Endpoints that return JSON. This allows developers in the Frontend to interact with Backend data. API is a contract between the Frontend and Backend on how to share data. . FYI, there is NO output from this section . . from flask import Blueprint, jsonify # jsonify creates an endpoint response object from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building import requests # used for testing import random # Blueprints allow this code to be procedurally abstracted from main.py, meaning code is not all in one place app_api = Blueprint(&#39;api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/jokes&#39;) # endpoint prefix avoid redundantly typing /api/jokes over and over # API generator https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id1 api = Api(app_api) class JokesAPI: # not implemented, this would be where we would allow creation of a new Joke class _Create(Resource): def post(self, joke): pass # getJokes() class _Read(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getJokes()) # getJoke(id) class _ReadID(Resource): def get(self, id): return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadRandom(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getRandomJoke()) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadCount(Resource): def get(self): count = countJokes() countMsg = {&#39;count&#39;: count} return jsonify(countMsg) # put method: addJokeHaHa class _UpdateLike(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeHaHa(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # put method: addJokeBooHoo class _UpdateJeer(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeBooHoo(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # building RESTapi interfaces, these routes are added to Web Server http://&lt;server&lt;/api/jokes api.add_resource(_Create, &#39;/create/&lt;string:joke&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_Read, &#39;/&#39;) # default, which returns all jokes api.add_resource(_ReadID, &#39;/&lt;int:id&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadRandom, &#39;/random&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadCount, &#39;/count&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateLike, &#39;/like/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateJeer, &#39;/jeer/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) . Frontend (View Simulation) and Hacks . This python codes tests endpoints on a server. This can be handy for development and testing when making modifications to the Jokes Web APIs. This code works off of the server endpoint/url, not from code cells above it in this notebook. . To work with this code and make observation for learning... . Run a local server from flask_portfolio project and the change server variable to be local | Observe the requests endpoints and the output, see if you can observe what is happening/changing on put requests | The &quot;requests&quot; are captured into a List, the List is used in the for loop to extract from RESTful API format. | Try running this with Debugging and observe what data is being created at each step (Required) | Try to format this data in Python print statements to be more readable (Required) | Start and stop local server and observe errors | . # server = &quot;http://127.0.0.1:5000/&quot; # run local server = &#39;https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/&#39; # run from web server url = server + &quot;api/jokes/&quot; responses = [] # responses list # Get the count of jokes on server count_response = requests.get(url+&quot;count&quot;) count_json = count_response.json() count = count_json[&#39;count&#39;] # Update likes/dislikes test sequence num = str(random.randint(0, count-1)) # test a random record responses.append( requests.get(url+num) # Get/read joke by id ) responses.append( requests.put(url+&quot;like/&quot;+num) # Put/add to like count ) responses.append( requests.put(url+&quot;jeer/&quot;+num) # Put/add to jeer count ) # Get a random joke responses.append( requests.get(url+&quot;random&quot;) # Get/read a random joke ) # Cycle through and print responses for response in responses: print(response) try: print(response.json()) except: print(&quot;data error&quot;) .",

As more and more developers use APIs, they build standards in how you setup a client, send requests and receive information... . Covid19 RapidAPI Example . To begin the API journey. You need to find an API provider. . RapidAPI is a great option. You must setup and account, but there are many free options. | Goto this page for starters, the Corona virus World and India data- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests | . RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . &quot;&quot;&quot; Requests is a HTTP library for the Python programming language. The goal of the project is to make HTTP requests simpler and more human-friendly. &quot;&quot;&quot; import requests &quot;&quot;&quot; RapidAPI is the world&#39;s largest API Marketplace.
