To enhance the journey experience, Lucid plans to collaborate with Gracenote, an audio technology company that can potentially enhance Lucid’s sound system and its new entertainment system which can be used during long road trips. (Yahoo Finance 1/5/22) 

Summary: Lucid is a barely new electric car company with very little credit to its name. They will continue to struggle in the electric car market with competitors like Tesla and other major car manufacturers. Its upside is being highly luxurious while having the same torque as an electric car.
