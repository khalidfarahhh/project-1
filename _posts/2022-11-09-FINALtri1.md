# Trimester Reflection
-I feel in this trimester ive had great sucess with this course even tho my grade doesnt reflect it. To me its less about the grade and more about what I learn about coding and my self. This was a huge learning experience as I now know my habits in a course like this and some of the basic coding tools. I know that this upcoming tri I will get an A as I know what the teachers are looking for specifically and what they arent looking for. It was a very fun course to say the least and was a intresting new perspective on how classes could be taught. Project based learning was definitelty a highlight of the course as it was free will to learn without gidelines. I look foward to moving to the second trimester of this course with lots of learning and more effort.

 A little confused because it says already a list of of food and dietary restrictions so I this is a unclear question.

 Didnt know the answer so searched it up and seems so that google is not efficent as it gave me the wrong answer.

Also searched this up and showed me the exact question with the answer so I find it odd I still got it wrong.

This in my opinion used more logical math and physics then computer science and at the time my state of mind was completly and only computer science.

Followed the errows which I was later educated on that arrows do not mean anything in code so they were deceiving in sending me another way to solve the question.

# Questions I searched up
Question #16
Question #17
Question #19
Question #20
Question #25
