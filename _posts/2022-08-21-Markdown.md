# App Lab Plan

-My plan for the app lab quiz was to create a creative and good looking quiz through code.org. I wanted it to have a colorful theme and use live backgrounds as most of my projects are plain and I assumed not many people would think to use a gif as a background. I knew I wanted to use the kahoot style format to make the questions and have 4 options for each question. I chose to make the math questions easy so I can save time on the work but still demonstrate my understanding of how to show answers are wrong or right.
