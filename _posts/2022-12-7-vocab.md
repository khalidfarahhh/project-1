- Unit 2… Binary/Data Terms

its are the basic unit of information in computing, consisting of a single binary digit that can take on a value of 0 or 1.

Bytes are a unit of measurement for data storage, consisting of eight bits.

Hexadecimal, or hex, is a number system with base 16, often used in computing to represent binary data in a more human-readable format.

Nibbles are a unit of measurement for data, consisting of four bits.

A binary number is a number represented using only the digits 0 and 1.

An unsigned integer is a binary number that represents a non-negative whole number, without any representation of sign.

A signed integer is a binary number that represents a whole number, with a separate representation of sign (positive or negative).

A floating point number is a binary number that represents a real number, with a separate representation of the decimal point.

A Boolean is a binary data type that can take on one of two possible values, representing true or false.

ASCII is a character encoding standard that represents each letter, digit, and symbol as a unique binary number.

Unicode is a character encoding standard that represents most of the world's written languages, including all of the characters in ASCII, as well as many additional characters.

RGB (Red-Green-Blue) is a color model used in computing to represent colors as a combination of red, green, and blue values.

Data compression is the process of reducing the amount of data required to represent a given amount of information, typically to save space or transmission time.

Lossy data compression involves discarding some of the data in order to achieve a higher level of compression.

Lossless data compression involves preserving all of the data, but encoding it in a more compact form.
