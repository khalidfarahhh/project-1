# 5.1

Improved communication and collaboration
Enhanced education and learning opportunities
Harmful effects:

Corresponding harmful effects:

Cybersecurity threats and privacy concerns
Addiction and decreased physical activity
Job displacement and loss of personal touch in communication.

Dopamine issue:
Yes dopamine issues are very real. I have experienced it my self scrolling through tik tok and social media for hours. It is a real issue and definetely impact my personal study and success in highschool

# 5.2
Someone empowers themself by using technology to better their own lives, as well as the lives of others and using technology to benefit the world.

Something that someone empowered could do to help someone not empowered at Del Norte is, maybe if the student body really wants a change to happen or an event or theme to happen then ASB could push it through and try to make it happen

Yes an example of one of these barriers is the financial aspect. This goes for all of the world as well because without the recources of technolgoy you cant make urself digitally empowered.
