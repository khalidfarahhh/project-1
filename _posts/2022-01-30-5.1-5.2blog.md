Dopamine issue:
Yes dopamine issues are very real. I have experienced it my self scrolling through tik tok and social media for hours. It is a real issue and definetely impact my personal study and success in highschool

# 5.2
Someone empowers themself by using technology to better their own lives, as well as the lives of others and using technology to benefit the world.

Something that someone empowered could do to help someone not empowered at Del Norte is, maybe if the student body really wants a change to happen or an event or theme to happen then ASB could push it through and try to make it happen

Yes an example of one of these barriers is the financial aspect. This goes for all of the world as well because without the recources of technolgoy you cant make urself digitally empowered.

- Computer bias 
I feel like the bias between ages from google to tik tok is purposeful as over time facebook developers realised their audience was older people and started to shift its company towards pleasing that age group
As for tik tok it ranges to all ages in my opinion now
- Virtual Assistance
The voices on these assitants are intentional as a women is seen as more friendly and caring. This is to make the experience more user friendly and nice. It is purposeful and it is not harmful, good business.

- HP computer
I think this was not intentional as they just didnt account for this problem too occur.

I think this happened just because their software wasnt experienced enough and they did run enough tests with people of a darker skin tone.

It should defintely be corrected.


# 5.4 
- Crowd sourcing 
A way to initiate crowd sourcing within CSP is to give a website where people can put their own opinions on the class. This will have a variety of opinions and through an average rating out of 10 collected by all inputs we can demonstrate the rate at which students like the class and display this to future csp students. This will let them determine if they wanna take the class or not.

I dont see how our product could be better with crowd sourcing.

The type of data I could collect is maybe evaluate how many people enter a certain classroom and compare this to another classroom to determinate which subject has a higher interest between students parents.
