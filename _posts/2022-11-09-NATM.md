Here is an animation from a student in computer animation. Its an awesome photo of legos having a donut party. It shows the creativity in these students and I like the photo alot. It was probably my favorite out of the whole class.

# Reflection
I think night at the museum was great and super fun. Id have to say my favorite part of the night would have to be presenting to Mr.Young and showing off our project. It was also cool to see everyone elses projects and how they made creative projects while following the college board guidlines. I think my favorite room that I visited was the drawing and painting room as it was very impressive and some of the drawings there that arent shown on my blog looked so realistic yet animted which amazes me.
