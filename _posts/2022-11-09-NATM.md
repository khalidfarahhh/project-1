# Reflection
I think night at the museum was great and super fun. Id have to say my favorite part of the night would have to be presenting to Mr.Mortensen and showing off our project. It was also cool to see everyone elses projects and how they interpreted the directions. I think my favorite room I visited was the drawing and painting room as it was very impressive and some of the drawings there that arent shown on my blog looked so realistic yet animted which amazes me.
