# Reflection
- It was an easy MCQ and I think I did very good despite getting 4 wrong. I hope next time to get a 100 percent and I hope I can get above a 2.7 for getting more than 90 percent. I have studied each of the problems I got wrong and did corrections to understand what the correct answer is and why. I wont get these wrong again.
