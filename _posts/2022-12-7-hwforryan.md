excercise 1
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] reversed = [] for value in list: reversed = [value] + reversed print(reversed)

excercise 2
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] reversed = [] for value in list: reversed = [value] + reversed print(reversed)

reflection
I learned how to create a bubble sort list and learned what each command does and how to write it. Also how to create a reversed list and print.

I got this question wrong because I thought that the position of an element in a list, starts at 1 but it starts at zero.

[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

My Notebook isnâ€™t working so I put the code in a Markdown.
