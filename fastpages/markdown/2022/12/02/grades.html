</ul><p>For joselyns group (3.1-2) I received .8/1 because I didnt do a section of the hacks/hw. I was unaware of this section as it was titled hacks and the section following was titled homework hacks so I assumed the hack previously was extra work and not due as homework. For the rest I just put the answer and a breif exlpanation.</p>

<p>For theo’s group (3.3-4) I received a .95/1 because I completed all the questions and had answers as well as a breif explanation. I also had multiple creative word problems I made myself.</p>

<p>For Lukes group I got a .9/1 I did nothing special just completed everything on time and submitted on time. Had good clear work.</p>

<p>For varloo’s group I got a .7  I did everything and had good clean work nothing extra or less was done.</p>

<p>For qais’s group I got a .8. I did everything but i submitted it late</p>
