To me its less about the grade and more about what I learn about coding and my self. This was a huge learning experience as I now know my habits in a course like this and some of the basic coding tools. I know that this upcoming tri I will get an A as I know what the teachers are looking for specifically and what they arent looking for. It was a very fun course to say the least and was a intresting new perspective on how classes could be taught. Project based learning was definitelty a highlight of the course as it was free will to learn without gidelines. I look foward to moving to the second trimester of this course with lots of learning and more effort." />

<p>-I feel in this trimester ive had great sucess with this course even tho my grade doesnt reflect it. To me its less about the grade and more about what I learn about coding and my self. This was a huge learning experience as I now know my habits in a course like this and some of the basic coding tools. I know that this upcoming tri I will get an A as I know what the teachers are looking for specifically and what they arent looking for. It was a very fun course to say the least and was a intresting new perspective on how classes could be taught. Project based learning was definitelty a highlight of the course as it was free will to learn without gidelines. I look foward to moving to the second trimester of this course with lots of learning and more effort.</p>

<p><img src="/project-1/images/incorrect1.png" alt="">
 A little confused because it says already a list of of food and dietary restrictions so I this is a unclear question.</p>

<p><img src="/project-1/images/incorrect2.png" alt="">
 Didnt know the answer so searched it up and seems so that google is not efficent as it gave me the wrong answer.</p>

<p><img src="/project-1/images/incorrect3.png" alt="">
Also searched this up and showed me the exact question with the answer so I find it odd I still got it wrong.</p>

<p><img src="/project-1/images/incorrect4.png" alt="">
This in my opinion used more logical math and physics then computer science and at the time my state of mind was completly and only computer science.</p>

<p><img src="/project-1/images/incorrect5.png" alt="">
Followed the errows which I was later educated on that arrows do not mean anything in code so they were deceiving in sending me another way to solve the question.</p>

<h1 id="questions-i-searched-up">
<a class="anchor" href="#questions-i-searched-up" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Questions I searched up</h1>
<p>Question #16
Question #17
Question #19
Question #20
Question #25
Question #30</p>

<h1 id="strengths-and-weakness">
<a class="anchor" href="#strengths-and-weakness" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Strengths and weakness</h1>
<ul>
  <li>I think my strengths in this class are definetely more front end stuff and the visual pleasure of the website. I feel its more simple and the work I put in is rewarded better in a sense because of how I can see my work. My weakness would have to be backend and the more complicated coding aspect. I am going to up the work load and diffuculty of my work in the second trimester to improve my knowledge</li>
