Here is a photo of james working vigerously  before his presentation at night at the museum. Him and his group are preparing their website to show to other students as well. Their project was very interesting and cool.</p>

<p><img src="/project-1/images/photo2.png" alt="">
Here is a drawing by a student in drawing and paintng. It is very detailed and I can tell they spent excessive time completing this. Its awesome to see other students thriving in different aspects of creativity.</p>

<p><img src="/project-1/images/photo3.png" alt="">
Here is another drawing in drawing and painting. The drawing depicts some type of war and theirs many details that show this theme. Its a very good detailing drawing and I like it.</p>

<p><img src="/project-1/images/groupworking.png" alt="">
Here is an abundance of kids all working around eachother finishing the last pieces of their projects. The energy was high and you can tell that from the photo as they are excited to show off their work.</p>

<p><img src="/project-1/images/computeranimation.png" alt="">
Here is an animation from a student in computer animation. Its an awesome photo of legos having a donut party. It shows the creativity in these students and I like the photo alot. It was probably my favorite out of the whole class.</p>

<p>I think night at the museum was great and super fun. Id have to say my favorite part of the night would have to be presenting to Mr.Young and showing off our project. It was also cool to see everyone elses projects and how they made creative projects while following the college board guidlines. I think my favorite room that I visited was the drawing and painting room as it was very impressive and some of the drawings there that arent shown on my blog looked so realistic yet animted which amazes me.</p>
